// To demonstrate the use of StringBuilder and StringBuffer, you can add examples for both in your code. Here is the updated code:



// In

// Java, "thread-safe" means that a class or 

// method can be safely used by multiple threads at the same time without causing any problems such as data corruption or unexpected behavior. StringBuffer is thread-safe because its methods are synchronized, meaning that only one thread can access a method at a time.

// Here is an example demonstrating both StringBuilder (not thread-safe) and StringBuffer (thread-safe):



public class StringBufferExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // StringBuilder (Not Thread-Safe)
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sb.append(" World!");
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello World!

        // StringBuffer (Thread-Safe)
        StringBuffer sbf = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        sbf.append(" World!");
        System.out.println(sbf); // Output: Hello World!
    }
}



// StringBuilder is used for mutable strings when thread safety is not a concern.

// StringBuffer is used for mutable strings when thread safety is required.

// Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer provide similar functionality for string manipulation, such as appending, inserting, deleting, and replacing characters in a string.

// StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer because it is not thread-safe, while StringBuffer is slower due to its synchronized methods.
